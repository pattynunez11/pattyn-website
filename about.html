                <h3>Values I Carry As A UXUI Designer From Experience:</h3>


                <!--values -->
                <h4>Consistency and Communication</h4>
<p>Familiarity through consistent visual cues, information architecture and consistent patterns. Help guide the user through interactions to complete a task or service. </p>
<p>
Freelancing in Visual Design, presentations, sketches, comps, and wireframes, focused design process. Through iterations up to the final delivery clients had familiarity, resulting in trust. Understanding task expectations at each phase helped ensure successful designs.</p>

 <h4>Understanding the Research and Behavior For MVP and Backlog</h4>
<p>Notable changes through research. Efficient time management to deliver, the minimal viable product. Track backlog for feature additions.</p> 
<p>
As an independent gardener, clients, like a stakeholder, had specific needs. I would research the landscape and take note how the plants behave in the environment. Made decisions based on data, and observations for biggest impact within a block of time. Kept track of a 'backlog' to revisit at a later appointment for continued improvement.</p>

                <h4>The user drives the design</h4>
<p>Design is a balance of function, information architecture, aesthetics and innovation. The target audience is the indicator if a product has fulfilled its purpose.</p>
<p>
As a warehouse supervisor, my job was to keep operations optimal. Observation of production, logistics, and customer satisfaction were key. If a customer had an issue, hearing them out helped to address the problem to reach a compromise. Investigations into customers' pain points resulted in refinement of production and service.</p>
