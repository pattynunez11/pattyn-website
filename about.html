                        In 5th grade year, our class got a MacIntosh. One computer for 28 kids. To my surprise, and luck, it was only four of us who had any interest. We decided to figure out what it does. For the rest of the year, we spent our lunch break, typing in code. The result of all those lines of code was satisfying to see, a waving USA flag on the dark screen. After every successful coded graphic we would all grin from ear to ear. It was as if we discovered how to communicate with an alien. Although after that year I will not see a computer for a very long time, it defined my value of collaboration and a personal computer.

                <p>
                        An old set of Children's encyclopedias, came as an escape from a rowdy house of teen boys. My room became my sanctuary. My friend, an encyclopedia set. I can still remember the red pleather covers, and gold foiled typeface on the book spines. The type, images and illustrations, intrigued and compelled me to read and dream. I wanted to be a scientist of bugs, plants, and the stars. It planted the seed in my growth as a lifelong learner.

                        I took four years of photography and art. During that time, I worked at a 1-Hr video delivery service in NYC. When I went for the interview, a person sat in front with a computer, yelling out names. A person in the back opened boxes, and entered data on a computer. Then another scanned videos into a computer and packed them up. The biker collected the package and zipped away. That computer spark and the collaboration ignited. I wanted to be a part of that. There was plenty of banter to be had and tech was a hot topic with the workers there. They were future 3D animators, computer scientist, and emerging tech/artist. I was right slap in the middle of the dot com hype. I figured out how the intranet, database, and web worked within all departments. I transferred back to SF, CA and I supervised over production, customer service and dispatch. Then the dot com era went Boom - Fizzle - Burst. Unfortunate events can bring about good change. I had to either do the same, a warehouse supervisor, or move into something new.

            <img src="images/about/xglass.png" alt="an old photoshop version of the interface">
            <p>
                    I discovered graphic design by asking a friend what they did. I heard. “… I use computers, to make artwork ...combine type with images..” I had an Aha Moment! The next semester I took Photoshop at CCSF. I got hooked. I enrolled at San Francisco State for Industrial Arts. The program focused on research and development-design thinking. What resonates from those studies are; do the research, listen, and get used to learning as you go. So after graduating, I began freelancing. I taught myself project management, ane enough -html, css,  javascript, and the apps to get the job done.

                <p>
                        The encyclopedia had a section on botany - my dream to be a scientist of plants. When an opportunity to be a horticulturist presented itself, and a flexible schedule, I took it. As a single mom it worked perfectly. During the 10 years, design would be present. Over time, I found myself doing more gardening. As much as I enjoyed horticulture, design was like the one that got away. I took time to do some traveling throughout southeast asia.

                <p>
                    Linking past events, including the few I shared here, and all that good introspection while traveling, it revealed that I must immerse myself in design and find a team to be a part of. And in order to make sure I can have the right set of skills, I started the apprentice program at BLOC, the Designer Track. I now have a strong foundation from research to product development on top of my visual design skills. And here I am presenting digital products in my portfolio with past work, with a hope I can find a mutual fit.
