                    <h1>Overview</h1>
                    <p>The project was initiated by exploring the possibilities
                        in the cloud
                        storage market. Deciding which industry to explore was
                        difficult, it is
                        vast. I created a framework to narrow it down. I looked
                        into popular
                        cloud service providers with a common service. It turned
                        out to be
                        photos. The Them Photos is a cloud storage geared at
                        photography
                        enthusiasts. This app will be a tool that takes it a
                        step further by
                        allowing users to control their organization of photos
                        by having access
                        to the features with a different approach to the
                        interface.</p>

                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>Users had minimal time invested into photos being stored.
                        There was no sense of value for the product that catered
                        to a general audience. As robust as the apps were, they
                        lacked access to tools for organzing photos.</p>

                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>Creating an interface that is transparent to access
                        features to complete tasks in an app will add value to a
                        target market therefore retaining them onto one
                        platform.</p>

                        <h1>The Discovery Phase</h1>
                    </header>
                    <h2>Innovation Intent</h2>
                    <p>To create a cloud photo storage space for photographers,
                        creatives with capabilities to collaborate with others,
                        develop a network/community and help with a marketing
                        platform to connect and share images.</p>
                    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                    <p>In order to get an idea, I created a SWOT matrix to
                        determine if the market had gaps for opportunities to
                        develop my initial intention, to create an app for
                        creatives and avid photographers.</p>
                    <h2>Ahh Moment!</h2>
                    <p>After doing the SWOT and with further research, I
                        discovered that photos are not accessed again. Is it
                        Lack of value or user interacation with the app? Google
                        Photos brand focuses on family and friends and does not
                        cater to avid photographers, Adobe does with a price.
                        Flickr and Lightroom have a learning curve for the
                        average photo taker.</p>

                        <h2>Sketches to Wireframe</h2>
                        <p>My approach to the wireframes was to focus on
                            chunking tasks and its affordability to the
                            user. I generated sketches and brainstormed
                            solutions. Next was to find basic design
                            patterns to execute a clickable wireframe.
                            This will allow me to move forward with the
                            least amount of time investment. And into
                            usability testing to see if the interface is
                            effective. The thought was to get useful
                            results to put in place. It will also be
                            easier to make progress with future
                            iterations of the design.</p>

                    <p>Creating the name of the app While doing word
                        associations with photography, ‘them’ would come up.
                        What do people do with them? What do I do with them? Out
                        of a little frustration, I said ‘..photos, what do you
                        do with them, Them Photos.’</p>
                    <h2>Concept</h2>
                    <p>I utilized word associations and mind mapping to develope
                        a concept. Words that resonated were ‘structure and
                        organization'. Boxes of analog photography items and
                        colors inspired by transparent contrast filters sparked
                        the direction of the brand. </p>

                            is
                            the beginning to a simplified interface. There are
                            people that want to have control over their photos.
                            Have
                            access by having the features on their task bar.</p>
