                <p>This 1.5 month project was a part of a 9-month mentorship. I developed a product for a client who wanted to enter the cloud storage service industry. I produced an app for mobile and web that allows users to upload, save and share files.</p>

                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p>The phone camera has become the recorder of events in people’s lives. They take so many photos, that they get lost in the abyss somewhere in a free cloud storage service. Although there is an AI to assist in certain services, it is rarely used according to a user survey conducted. Professional photographers, creatives, and bloggers mostly use hard drives as a storage system for their images. For them it is a lack of trust that their work would be lost. Although the trust here is defined more on the technical assurance, trust in cloud storage services needs to be addressed.</p>

                <h1>The Solution</h1>
                <p>Instead of automatic or manual uploads on the phone of vast quantities of images, or waiting to get to a desktop to save, share and organize images, the immediacy of the phone can help do the task. The user’s investment in inputting categories, tags, labels within the phone app, adds value and improves the AI. To develop trust, the interface has to be accessible and user friendly for control of image storage.</p>

            <!--START DISCOVERY phase-->

            <section>

                    <!-- REMOVE FOR NOW - not sure if it tells the right story --<h1>Discovery Phase</h1>
                </header>

                <p>To create a cloud photo storage space for avid photographers,
                    and creatives with capabilities to share with others,
                    develop a network/community and upkeep of photo storage.
                    Another intention is to have the app automatically save
                    photos once a feature is initialized, saving time. Creating
                    features to allow the user to control organization and be
                    the human loop to AI. The following is how and why I came up
                    and executed my intention.</p>-->
                <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
                <p>In order to get an idea, I created a SWOT matrix to
                    determine if the market had gaps for opportunities, to
                    create an app for
                    creatives and avid photographers.</p>
                <h1>Ahh Moment!</h1>
                <p>After doing the SWOT and with further research, I
                    discovered that photos are not accessed again. Is it
                    lack of value or lack of user interaction with the app?
                    Google
                    Photos brand focuses on family and friends and does not
                    cater to avid photographers, Adobe does but with a price
                    most are unwilling to pay.
                    Flickr, Google, and Lightroom have a learning curve to
                    access advanced features to control photo storage.</p>

                    but after a few

                <h1>Visual - Sketches to Wireframes</h1>
                <p>My approach to the wireframes was to focus on
                    chunking tasks and making it easy for the user to get to the
                    tools.

                    Next was to find basic design
                    patterns to execute a clickable wireframe.
                    This will allow me to move forward with the
                    least amount of time investment. And into
                    usability testing to see if the interface is
                    effective. The thought was to get useful
                    results to put in place. It will also be
                    easier to make progress with future
                    iterations of the design.</p>

                        the concern was not in the steps it took to execute the

                <h1>Branding</h1>
                <p>Creating the name of the app While doing word
                    associations with photography, ‘them’ would come up.
                    What do people do with them? What do I do with them? Out
                    of a little frustration, I said ‘..photos, what do you
                    do with them, Them Photos.’</p>
                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p>I utilized word associations and mind mapping to develope
                    a concept. Words that resonated were ‘structure and
                    organization'. Boxes of analog photography items and
                    colors inspired by transparent contrast filters sparked
                    the direction of the brand. </p>

                <p>After the usability testing on the wireframe
                    clickable I wanted to focus on three tasks to
                    tighten the interface with the branding. The results
                    were not as successful in the menu set up.
                    Typography lacked hierarchy structure. The users
                    were unsure where to go first at boarding that was
                    associated with uncertainty if they were working off
                    their phone or on the cloud server.</p>
                <ul title="Positive" class="sym">
                    <li>Visual cues between elements were distinguishable
                    </li>

                            help with views. Also minimal color for images to be
                            the main focal point.</span>

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>Expereimenting with the interface by chunking tasks
                    is
                    the beginning to a simplified interface. There are
                    people that want to have control over their photos.
                    Have
                    access by having the features on their task bar.</p>

                <h1>Takeaways</h1>
                <ul class="sym-blue">
                    <li> Material Design’s UI System is a good place to
                        begin looking at familiar interface patterns</li>
                    <li> The Floating Actionable Button really helped in
                        refining chunking of tasks</li>
                    <li>Creating a clickable wireframe allowed me to work out
                        solutions for UI developement</li>
