                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>The project was initiated by exploring the possibilities
                    in the cloud
                    storage market. Deciding which industry to explore was
                    difficult, it is
                    vast. I created a framework to narrow it down. I looked
                    into popular
                    cloud service providers with a common service. It turned
                    out to be
                    photos. The Them Photos is a cloud storage geared at
                    photography
                    enthusiasts. This app will be a tool that takes it a
                    step further by
                    allowing users to control their organization of photos
                    by having access
                    to the features with a different approach to the
                    interface.</p>

                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Users had minimal time invested into photos being stored.
                    There was no sense of value for the product that catered
                    to a general audience. As robust as the apps were, they
                    lacked access to tools for organzing photos.</p>

                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>Creating an interface that is transparent to access
                    features to complete tasks in an app will add value to a
                    target market therefore retaining them onto one
                    platform.</p>

                    <h1>Discovery Phase</h1>
                </header>
                <h2>Innovation Intent</h2>
                <p>To create a cloud photo storage space for photographers,
                    creatives with capabilities to collaborate with others,
                    develop a network/community and help with a marketing
                    platform to connect and share images.</p>
                <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                <p>In order to get an idea, I created a SWOT matrix to
                    determine if the market had gaps for opportunities to
                    develop my initial intention, to create an app for
                    creatives and avid photographers.</p>
                <h2>Ahh Moment!</h2>
                <p>After doing the SWOT and with further research, I
                    discovered that photos are not accessed again. Is it
                    Lack of value or user interacation with the app? Google
                    Photos brand focuses on family and friends and does not
                    cater to avid photographers, Adobe does with a price.
                    Flickr and Lightroom have a learning curve for the
                    average photo taker.</p>

                <h2>Sketches to Wireframes</h2>
                <p>My approach to the wireframes was to focus on
                    chunking tasks and making it easy for the user to get to the tools.
                    
                    Next was to find basic design
                    patterns to execute a clickable wireframe.
                    This will allow me to move forward with the
                    least amount of time investment. And into
                    usability testing to see if the interface is
                    effective. The thought was to get useful
                    results to put in place. It will also be
                    easier to make progress with future
                    iterations of the design.</p>

At this point the concern was not in the steps it took to execute the tasks but in an overall view of tasks working together within an interface.

                    What do people do with them? What do I do with them? Out
                    of a little frustration, I said ‘..photos, what do you
                    do with them, Them Photos.’</p>
                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p>I utilized word associations and mind mapping to develope
                    a concept. Words that resonated were ‘structure and
                    organization'. Boxes of analog photography items and
                    colors inspired by transparent contrast filters sparked
                    the direction of the brand. </p>

                <p>After the usability testing on the wireframe

                    tighten the interface with the branding. The results
                    were not as successful in the menu set up.
                    Typography lacked hierarchy structure. The users
                    were unsure where to go first at boarding that was
                    associated with uncertainty if they were working off
                    their phone or on the cloud server.</p>

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>Expereimenting with the interface by chunking tasks
                    is
                    the beginning to a simplified interface. There are
                    people that want to have control over their photos.
                    Have
                    access by having the features on their task bar.</p>

                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                <ul class="sym-blue">
                    <li> Material Design’s UI System is a good place to
                        begin looking at familiar interface patterns</li>
                    <li> The Floating Actionable Button really helped in
                        refining chunking of tasks</li>
                    <li>Creating a clickable wireframe allowed me to work out
                        solutions for UI developement</li>
